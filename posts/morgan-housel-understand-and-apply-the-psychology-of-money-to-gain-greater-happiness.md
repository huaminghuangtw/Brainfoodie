> _“Money absolutely can buy happiness. It’s often though an indirect path. […] A big fancy house? Maybe. But what really makes you happy is hosting friends and family there. A nice vacation? Sure. But it’s the memories you form with your loved ones that matter. So you can’t say money doesn’t make people happy—it does[, just not in the way you might think].” — Morgan Housel_

> _“I think a good formula for a pretty good life at the simplest level is independence plus purpose. You need to have a purpose that is bigger than yourself. […] You need to have the independence to make sure you can do it on your own terms rather than chasing somebody else’s goal. That’s the highest level of psychological well-being, independence and purpose.” — Morgan Housel_

> _“Using money as a tool can make you happier. Spending money can make you happier. But it’s not the thing that makes you happier. It’s just a tool to do other things and acquire other things that actually make you happy.” — Morgan Housel_
