> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
>
> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
>
> It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.
>
> We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
>
> Actually, who are you not to be?
>
> You are a child of God.
>
> Your playing small does not serve the world.
>
> There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.
>
> We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
>
> It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.
>
> And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
>
> As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
