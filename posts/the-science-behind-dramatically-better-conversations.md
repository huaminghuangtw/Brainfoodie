We tend to think of a discussion as **one** conversation. But, in fact, each discussion contains **many** conversations.

---

“Supercommunicators” understand that whenever we speak, we’re actually participating in one of the three conversations:

1. **Practical**: _What is this really about?_ → You offer help.
2. **Emotional**: _How do we feel?_ → You simply listen.
3. **Social**: _Who are we?_ → You reciprocate vulnerability.

# The Matching Principle

* Successful communication requires recognizing what _kind_ of conversation is occurring and _matching_ one another.
* If you don’t know what kind of conversation you’re having, it’s unlikely to connect.
* When you’re frustrated that someone isn’t listening, the real problem might be that you’re having different types of conversations. Next time, pause and ask yourself: What kind of conversation are we actually having? Then match their energy.

# How to figure out which of the three conversations we’re in?

Ask “deep questions”: <mark>Instead of asking the _facts_ of someone’s life, ask how they _feel_ about life.</mark>

1. Where do you work? → What do you love about your job?
2. Where did you go to high school? → What was high school like? What did you learn there? What changed you there?
3. “When was the last time you cried in front of someone?”
