Start slow (**warmer then colder**)—as [cold shock (冷休克)](https://www.google.com/search?q=cold+shock) is possible; just as with lifting weights or other forms of exercise.

The water temperature should be **uncomfortably cold yet safe** to stay in for a few minutes. The colder the stimulus (water immersion, shower, etc.), the shorter amount of time you need to expose yourself to the cold.

# The “Counting Walls” Approach

* **The Concept of Walls**
	* “Walls” are the mental barriers or resistance you feel (e.g., “Get me out of here”).
	* They are caused by adrenaline pulses. Overcoming them triggers the adaptive response.
* **Top-Down Control (Resilience & Grit)**
	* Staying in the cold despite the urge to exit exerts ‘top-down control’ from the prefrontal cortex over reflexive brain centers.
	* This builds resilience and grit.
* **The Method**
	* Challenge yourself by [counting walls](https://youtu.be/pq6WHJzOkno?t=2308).
	* Set a goal of “walls” to traverse (e.g., 3–5 walls) per session.
* **Progression Levels**
	* **Level 1:** Stay completely still.
		* Keeps a thermal layer around your body (insulation).
	* **Level 2:** Move your limbs.
		* Breaks the thermal layer; makes it feel much colder.

# The Søeberg Principle

Based on deliberate cold researcher [Dr. Susanna Søeberg](https://www.instagram.com/susanna_soeberg/), the principle is: _To enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own._ (a.k.a “End With Cold”).

* **Shivering** is the key component.

	> _If you want to use deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism, you should get to the point where you shiver in the cold exposure or immediately after._

* **Method: Natural Reheating**
	* Let your body reheat naturally by drying yourself out in the air for about 1–3 minutes.
	* **Avoid:**
		* Toweling off.
		* Standing under a warm shower.
		* Huddling or crossing your arms while in the cold or after getting out.
