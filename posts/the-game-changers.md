# [How to Eat Like A Game Changer?](https://gamechangersmovie.com)

* Egg Substitutes
	* Eggs in recipes can be replaced with _mashed banana_, _unsweetened applesauce_, _silken tofu_, _chickpea flour_.[^1]
	* Both **flax seeds** and **chia seeds** can also be blended with water to create the consistency of raw egg white.
	* For baking, the liquid in a can of [chickpeas](https://www.google.com/search?q=chickpeas) [^2] is called _aquafaba_ and is an excellent egg substitute.
		* Aquafaba 是煮熟鷹嘴豆所產生的液體（常來自罐頭鷹嘴豆），能模擬蛋白的「打發」特性，用來取代打發蛋白製作海綿口感或穩定泡沫（如蛋白霜、馬卡龍、鬆餅等）。
		* The equivalent of one egg is about 3 tablespoons of _aquafaba_:
			* 2 tablespoons are about the same as one egg white.
			* 1 tablespoon is around the same as one egg yolk.
* Milk Substitutes
	* Almond, soy and coconut are the most commonly found plant milks.

[^1]: This works particularly well for omelettes and eggless scrambles!
