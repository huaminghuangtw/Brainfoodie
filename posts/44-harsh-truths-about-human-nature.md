> The only true test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life. [^1] [^2] [^3]

1. 想：知道自己想要/不想要什麼、定義自己的平衡/甜蜜點
2. 做：有能力真正地得到/避免自己想要/不想要的東西、想辦法站在上面，死都不要下來

> [We don’t spend enough time thinking about the big questions in life. They are big questions for good reasons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1h24m19s)

> [3 Big Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1h40m42s)
> * Who are you with?
> * What are you doing?
> * Where are you living?

> Most of the problems come when you are prematurely committing to them.

> [I would have done everything the same except I would have done it with _less anger, less emotion, less internal suffering because that was optional.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=360s) Don’t make suffering as proxy for progress._

> The more you take yourself seriously, the unhappier you are. Because that seriousness will bound you to behave in a particular manner.

> [Pleasure can override happiness and create kind of this illusion of happiness. If you ask people when they felt genuinely happy for an extended time, they were probably doing some variation of nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=4137s)

> [Any moment when you’re not in that moment, you are dead to that moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1h25m15s)

> [At any moment when you’re not having a good time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1942s)

> People want surprises for happiness. They want world to surprise them.

> [Two paths to happiness: One path is success; you get what you want, you satisfy your material needs. Or like Diogenes, you just don’t want in the first place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=64s)

> [Many desires are unnecessary and can be sources of unhappiness. If you want to be successful, you have to be _choosy_ about your desires. You can’t be great in everything.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=462)

> [If you want to do a thing and you are fully into it, then it’s not a waste of time. Don’t do things that you don’t want to. If you don’t want to do it and your mind is running away from it and you’re reacting against it and you’re wishing you were somewhere else and you’re thinking about some other thing or you’re anticipating some future thing or regretting some past thing or being fearful of something, then that’s wasted time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1h25m33s)

> [When you want something, you will act on it with maximal capability. And that’s the time to act on it. In the mean time, \[you\] just do it because other people or the society tell you that you should do it, or you feel slightly guilty about it. These are half-hearted efforts. And half-hearted efforts don’t get you there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=1h20m2s)

> [It’s okay if you had 50 small failed ventures or 50 small failed job interviews. The number of failures doesn’t matter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=3508s)

> You have to enjoy your journey, the journey is all that there is; even success fades quickly.

> The real currency of life is attention. [A rational person should cultivate indifference to things that are out of their control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=3200s)

> [You want to be optimistic in the general, but you want to be skeptical about specific things. Every specific opportunity is probably a fail.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=3804s)

> [The alpha male eats last. The alpha male feeds everybody else first and then gets to eat last.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco&t=11678s)
> * They don’t just take the lead. They take responsibility. And [they eat last](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/21977839-leaders-eat-last-why-some-teams-pull-together-and-others-don-t) — not because they _have to_, but because they _choose to_.
> * It’s not about domination or ego — it’s about duty, service, and strength that uplifts others.

> Be your own best friend.

> We can’t put labels like introvert, extrovert, pessimistic etc. Humans are so dynamic and changes every moment. It depends on case-to-case basis.

[^2]: _[“The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.” — Morgan Housel](https://collabfund.com/blog/your-way-is-the-only-way/)_
[^3]: _[“If you define success on the basis of comparison to others, you will never feel successful. The only way to feel successful is to create your own definition of success, rather than consenting to one that was handed to you.” — Sahil Bloom](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/13-harsh-truths-about-success-nobody-told-you)_
