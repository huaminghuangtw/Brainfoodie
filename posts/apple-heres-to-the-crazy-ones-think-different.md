> Here’s to the crazy ones.
>
> The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
>
> The round pegs in the square holes.
>
> The ones who see things differently.
>
> They’re not fond of rules.
>
> And they have no respect for the status quo.
>
> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
>
> About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.
>
> Because they change things.
>
> They push the human race forward.
>
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
>
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
