> The only reason you become an actor, it’s said, is because you can’t do anything else. In many ways, this idea applies to book writing as well. For most authors, writing won’t be profitable—it’s not a good idea if your main goal is to make lots of money. Similarly, starting a company often follows this pattern. If you think a startup is your path to wealth, you’re likely just bad at math. <mark>Creative pursuits, whether writing or entrepreneurship, must come from a deeper place. You have to want the thing to exist so strongly that you’re willing to “birth” it into the world.</mark>
>
> This purpose-driven approach is essential. If you’re starting a company, do it because you want a specific product to exist—one that you personally want to use. The same applies to writing a book: <mark>write because you’re seeking an answer to a question, not because of what you already know. The most compelling writing often comes from curiosity rather than expertise. In other words, don’t write because you have all the answers; write because you want to discover them.</mark>
>
> <mark>For me, the process of writing is always a journey. I never have the answer in advance; instead, I write to uncover something new.</mark> Often, I’m motivated by dissatisfaction with the existing answers—I find them uninteresting or insufficient. Publishing a book is deeply tied to this drive, this “brain desire” to explore and create something meaningful.

> However, writing too early can be a dangerous trap. Premature writing often leads to frustration and discouragement. If you start before you’ve grasped the bigger picture, you’re likely to throw out much of your work. I’ve experienced this firsthand—there have been times when I thought the writing was going in one direction, only to find myself at a dead end. It simply didn’t work. <mark>Instead, I’ve found it far more productive to focus on gathering research and assembling the pieces first.</mark> By doing this, you can begin to shape something novel, something that offers value and genuinely contributes to the conversation.
